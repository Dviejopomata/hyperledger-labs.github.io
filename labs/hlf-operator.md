# Lab Name
Hyperledger Fabric Operator for Kubernetes

# Short Description
Manage Hyperledger Fabric components at scale with a Kubernetes Operator.

# Scope of Lab
There's a gap to deploy a Hyperledger Fabric network in Kubernetes, this project automates to automate the deployment.

The work will be focused on automating the creation of peers, orderers and CAs.

I have some ideas I would like to share such as developing a User Interface, and I think this could be integrated natively with the [fabric-operations-console](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-operations-console) which was recently released.
